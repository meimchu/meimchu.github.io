Hello world! I would like to start posting here on programming topics I am learning as a newly minted software engineer! I hope to make this a nice repository of Python and C++ topics that I have learned along the journey for both myself and whoever may stumble upon this Github Page. On top of programming topics, I hope to also discuss colour science subjects as well in my current role. All in all, lots of topics to discuss so let the fun begin!
