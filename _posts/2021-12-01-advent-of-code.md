Ever since I've known about Advent of Code, I always get pretty excited to do my best tackling it comes December.
This year is no different! Even though I may not always finish them due to a variety of reasons,
I always feel like I learn a bit with each attempt. This year, I come prepared with some greater understanding in terms of the grid and graph data structure traversal. Hopefully that will come in handy!

As always, my humble [Advent of Code](https://github.com/meimchu/AdventOfCode/) repository will get periodically updated.

Happy saving Santa Claus.
